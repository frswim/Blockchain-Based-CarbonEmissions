# Hybrid-Blockchain Based Carbon Emissions
This is a solution that involves integrating blockchain technology into the carbon emissions issue to address carbon emissions problems in the manufacturing or industrial sectors.  

  The system will be divided into themes focusing on [carbon emission monitoring](https://github.com/frswim/Blockchain-Based-CarbonEmissions/tree/main/%E7%A7%81%E6%9C%89%E9%8F%88%E5%BB%BA%E7%BD%AE%E7%A2%B3%E6%8E%92%E7%9B%A4%E6%9F%A5%E5%AD%90%E7%B3%BB%E7%B5%B1) and [carbon credit trading](https://github.com/frswim/Blockchain-Based-CarbonEmissions/tree/main/%E5%85%AC%E6%9C%89%E9%8F%88%E5%BB%BA%E7%BD%AE%E7%A2%B3%E6%AC%8A%E4%BA%A4%E6%98%93%E5%AD%90%E7%B3%BB%E7%B5%B1).
The following diagram illustrates the functional blocks of this integrated system.
